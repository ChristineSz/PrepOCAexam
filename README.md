My Labs for OCA exam Preparation
 ---------------------------------------
 What I Learned
 --------------
 Lab 01-Ide Familiarization -Using Eclipse
 
 Lab 02-Creating Classes-create MyDateClass and TestMyDate class
 
 Lab 03-Understanding Static variable -create OrderClass and TestOrder class
 
 Lab 04-Packages-create the packages: com.oca.domain,com.oca.testing,com.oca.utils

 Lab 05-Primitives-create the ConversinService class and TestConversinService class
 
 Lab 06-Encapsulation -Encapsulate the fields of MyDate class
 
 Lab 07-Inharitance-Create the classes :Good,Solid,Liquid and TestGoods
 
 Lab 08-Polymorphism-Updated TestOrder class to create and use an instance of a Good for a product field of an Order rather than aString
 
                    -Tested the new Order class with associated Good products by running TestOrder class
                    
                    -Polymorphism allows any specific object(Solid or Liquid) to be used in a general reference (Good in this case)
                    
 Lab 09-Abstarct  -Step 1 Modified the Good class to be abstract
 
                  -Step 2 Creating Services class
 
 Lab 10-Interfaces-Step 3 Creating Product interface-that generically describes a good or service
 
                  -Step 4 Refactor Order class again
                  
                  -Step 5 Create Orders with Service
                  
                  Used polimorphism with interface to allow Order objects to be associated with either a good or a service
